NTP (Network Time Protocol) isn't working for me on Linux. So I made my own! This is written in python and bash. It's an extremely simple network time protocol, that gets the time from the internet, rather than your computer.

Instructions to install:

1: download here:

https://github.com/PhoenixStormJr/alternate-simple-ntp-phoenix/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

2: Copy SetTime.py to /home/UserName/Phoenix_NTP/SetTime.py. If the folder does not exist, create it.




Google colab to test it:
